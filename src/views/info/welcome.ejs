            <h3>Insurance? What do I need to do?</h3>
            <p>Prescription insurance is a type of health coverage that helps pay for the cost of medicines your doctor prescribes. 
            Itâ€™s different from medical insurance because medical insurance mainly helps cover doctor visits, hospital stays, surgeries, and treatments.
            </p>
            <p>Think of it like this:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Medical insurance helps pay for when you go to the doctor or hospital.</li>
                <li>Prescription insurance helps pay for the medicine you get at the pharmacy.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Some medical insurance plans include prescription coverage, but not always.
            Sometimes, people need a separate prescription insurance plan to help make their medications more affordable. 
            Without it, medicines can be very expensive, especially if someone needs them regularly.
